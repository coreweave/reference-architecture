Provide a deeply technical explanation (≈800 words) of how zero-knowledge STARK proofs differ from SNARKs, including algebraic hash functions, AIR vs. R1CS, prover/verifier complexity, and real-world scaling benchmarks from projects like Starknet; end with three open research challenges.
Rewrite the following passage in Shakespearean iambic pentameter, keeping all proper nouns intact, but expanding every sentence with one additional metaphor drawn from nautical lore: “Quantum computers don’t break encryption directly; they break the assumptions that underpin hardness.”
Compose a detailed architectural decision record (ADR) for migrating a monolithic Django application to a micro-frontend React + FastAPI ecosystem on Kubernetes, covering context, decision, status, consequences, and alternative options—target length 1 000–1 200 words.
